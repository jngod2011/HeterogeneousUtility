There are three program files and one function used to find the steady state.

LinApp_FindSS.py is a Python function used to find the steady state.
IndivUtilHA.py solves the heterogenous agent model.
IndivUtilRA.py solves the representative agent model with modified Euler equations.
IndivUtilRA2.py solve the Representative agent model with unmodified Euler equations.
